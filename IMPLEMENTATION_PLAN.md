## ⚠️ NEEDS DISCUSSION: Macros/Nutrition Goals

**Conflict**: App principles explicitly exclude:
- ❌ Nutrient breakdown
- ❌ Daily goals  
- ❌ Progress tracking (gamification)

**Options:**

### Option A: Skip Entirely (Pure Principles)
- Stay true to non-judgmental philosophy
- Unique selling point: "No calorie counting, no goals, just patterns"

### Option B: Optional Reference (NOT Goals)
- Separate "Nutrition Reference" page
- Shows macros only when user requests
- No goals, no progress bars, no "you need X more"
- Labeled clearly: "Reference information, not targets"
- Optional toggle in settings

### Option C: Photo-Based Portion Awareness
- Upload food photo → AI estimates portion size
- NO calorie/macro numbers
- Just helps with logging: "This looks like roughly [size] of [food]"
- Focus on awareness, not counting

## 📝 Recommendation

**Implement aligned features first** (Phase 1-3), then **discuss macros** with stakeholders. The app's unique value is its non-judgmental approach - adding macro goals could undermine this.

Would you like me to:
1. Continue with Phase 2-3 implementation?
2. Discuss macro alternatives first?
3. Both (implement + document alternatives)?
